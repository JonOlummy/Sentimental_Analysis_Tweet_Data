# Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Data

In this project, we'll perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. We will analyze the sentiment of tweets to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. To get started, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Download Twitter Sentiment Data

1. Download the Twitter Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle using the following link:
   [Twitter Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/download?datasetVersionNumber=2)
   
   Make sure to save the dataset file (it's usually in CSV format) to your local machine.

## Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries

Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy
```

## Step 3: Set Up Jupyter Notebook

If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

After installation, open Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to your project directory and create a new Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.

## Step 4: Write and Run the Sentiment Analysis Code

In your Jupyter Notebook, write the Python code for sentiment analysis. You can use TensorFlow and other necessary libraries for this task. Here's a sample code structure:



Ensure that you follow best practices for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in your code.

## Step 5: Test the Model

After training your sentiment analysis model, you can test it with different sentences or Twitter data to check its performance. Use the model to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of various text inputs.
